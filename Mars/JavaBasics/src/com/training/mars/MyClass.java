/*Concepts:
Access Specifiers - public, private, protected

static: In java we need an object to access a class methods.
when we declare a method as static, we can call it without an object.
main method is static. Jvm looks for main method to start an application.

primitive vs non-primitive default values

variable - named memory location that contains data
types of variables: local / instance/ static
local - available only inside a block
instance- available for that object
instance - shared across objects and is accessed without instance

memory management - garbage collector finds unused variables and free up memory space

reference variables are treated as pointers in java

heap - objects reside in heap
stack - primitives and reference types reside here

varaible name:starts with char or (_ or $), camelCase,
